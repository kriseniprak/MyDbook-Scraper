# MyDbook-Scraper
This software allows you to download book pages from the **mydbook.giuntitvp.it** platform. To use it, simply log in and then enter the ID of the book to be downloaded, which can be picked up by going to open a book in the site. Once you have also set the number of pages to download, simply press the "Start scraping" button, to begin the process of saving images in the same folder where the software is located. During the scraping process, copy/paste functions cannot be used as they are in use by the software.
